/// letting eframe close the window. eframe drops the window while AppKit's run loop is still
/// running, and on Macs with a Touch Bar AppKit's next display cycle then tries to stop observing
/// a view that is gone: an uncaught exception that crashes (macOS 27) or leaves a windowless app
/// that only Force Quit ends (macOS 26) (#1458, #1575). `terminate:` ends the process before
/// another display cycle runs; winit's `applicationWillTerminate:` closes the windows and has
/// eframe save the window layout first, as the old ⌘Q (winit's default menu) did.
///
/// Scheduled on the main queue: winit has to be out of its event handler, or eframe's exit
/// handling (and the save) is dropped.
